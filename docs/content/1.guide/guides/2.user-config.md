## `client`

  - **type**: `boolean`
  - **default**: Enabled in dev or Non-SSR environments

Enables the client side rendering of the Schema.org client. 

When disabled will replace all references to composables and components with mocks, providing a 0kb runtime.

Notes:
- This should be enabled for SPA builds


## `full`

  - **type**: `boolean`
  - **default**: `false`

When building a complex Schema, you may come across certain limitations with the packages simple types.

To switch to using `schema-dts` types, set `full` to `true`.

When set to `false` the "simple" types are used which provide light-weight types which adhere to best practices from Google.

Notes:
- You may need to clear your working build directory once you switch, as the auto-imports will need to be updated.
- This requires using auto-imports


## `canonicalHost`

  - **type**: `string`
  - **default**: `window.location.origin`

  The production URL of your site. This allows the client to generate all URLs for you and is important to set correctly.

## `defaultLanguage`

  - **type**: `string`
  - **default**: `en`

  Will set the `isLanguage` to this value for any Schema which uses it. Should be a valid language code, i.e `en-AU`

## `defaultCurrency`

- **defaultCurrency**: `string`

  - **default**: `undefined`

  Will set the `priceCurrency` for [Product](/schema/product) Offer Schema. Should be a valid currency code, i.e `AUD`


## Types

```ts
interface UserConfig {
  /**
   * Should schema.org only be rendered by the server.
   *
   * Useful for optimising performance as it may not be needed by search engines. Changes runtime package size to 0kb.
   *
   * @default false
   */
  client?: boolean;
  /**
   * Should full schema types from `schema-dts` be used over a simplified version.
   *
   * @default false
   */
  full?: boolean;
  /**
   * Extra default metadata for the schema.org generation, you can use this as an alternative to the other meta.
   */
  meta?: BaseMetaInput;
  /**
   * The production URL of your site. This allows the client to generate all URLs for you and is important to set correctly.
   */
  canonicalHost?: `https://${string}`;
  /**
   * Will set the `isLanguage` to this value for any Schema which uses it. Should be a valid language code, i.e `en-AU`
   */
  defaultLanguage?: string;
  /**
   * Will set the `priceCurrency` for [Product](/schema/product) Offer Schema. Should be a valid currency code, i.e `AUD`
   */
  defaultCurrency?: string;
  /**
   * @deprecated You can remove this option, it doesn't do anything now.
   */
  debug?: boolean;
}
