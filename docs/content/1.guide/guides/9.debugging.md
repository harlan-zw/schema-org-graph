## Component: SchemaOrgDebug

The `SchemaOrgDebug` component is provided to quickly and visually debug the Schema on your page.

Add the component to your template to see the debugging output. It will also `console.debug` the current nodes.

Note: Make sure you remove this before pushing to production!

```vue
<template>
<div>
  <!-- ... -->
  <SchemaOrgDebug />
</div>
</template>
```

Now you can visually see the output.

## Third Party Validators

To confirm the schema generated is valid, you should run it through both https://validator.schema.org/ and https://search.google.com/test/rich-results.
