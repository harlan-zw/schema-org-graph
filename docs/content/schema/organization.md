See [Global Resolves](/guide/getting-started/how-it-works#global-resolves) for full context.

- address as `PostalAddress` object

- resolves string urls of `logo` into a `ImageObject` with the id of `#logo`

For example:

```ts
defineOrganization({
  name: 'Nuxt.js',
  logo: '/img/logo.png',
})
```

Will resolve the logo url into an ImageObject with the id of `#logo`

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "https://nuxtjs.org/#logo",
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://nuxtjs.org/img/logo.png"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://nuxtjs.org/#identity",
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "Nuxt.js",
      "logo": {
        "@id": "https://nuxtjs.org/#logo"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
